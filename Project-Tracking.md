# Project Tracking: Smart100 Algorithmic Trading App

This document tracks the major development phases, features, and future roadmap for the Smart100 application.

## Phase 1: Application Structure & Basic Suggestion Page Flow (Completed)

**Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (Current Date)

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **New Application Structure & Navigation:**
    - Implemented a client-side routing system using `react-router-dom`.
    - Introduced a horizontal navigation bar (`Navbar.tsx`) with three main sections:
        - **Suggestion:** A new page for an interactive strategy suggestion experience.
        - **Backtest:** The existing backtesting functionality, now a dedicated page.
        - **Cl√©s API:** A new page for managing user API keys, integrating the existing `ApiKeyManager.tsx` component.

*   **Suggestion Page (`SuggestionPage.tsx`) - Core Flow:**
    - **Step 1: User Input Form:**
        - Allows users to input "Capital Initial" and "Pourcentage du capital par transaction."
        - A "Lancer la suggestion" button triggers the process.
    - **Step 2: Display Suggestions:**
        - Fetches and displays up to 3 diverse strategy suggestions from the backend.
        - Each suggestion card shows:
            - Placeholder thematic name (e.g., "Suggestion Option 1").
            - Strategy Name and ID.
            - Symbol for the suggestion.
            - Available performance metrics (e.g., P&L score from AI evaluation).
            - Calculated max risk per trade based on user input.
            - A button to "Choisir et Backtester cette suggestion."
    - **Step 3: Display Basic Backtest Result:**
        - When a suggestion is chosen, a backtest is automatically run using default parameters (90-day period, Binance 1d data).
        - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Final Portfolio Value, Total P&L, Sharpe Ratio (if available), Max Drawdown (if available), and Total Trades are displayed textually.
        - Navigation options to return to the suggestions list or the initial form are provided.

*   **Backend API Adjustments:**
    - The `/api/ai/suggest-strategy` endpoint was enhanced to return a list of up to 3 suggestions.
    - Diagnostic logging was added to the backend to help troubleshoot scenarios with empty suggestion results.

*   **Styling:**
    - Basic CSS was added for the new navigation elements and page layouts for initial usability.

**Next Steps (Phase 2):** Focus on UI/UX refinements for the Suggestion Page, including thematic suggestion names, improved metrics display, animations, and integrating detailed charts for backtest results. 
*(Self-correction: This "Next Steps" should now point to Phase 3)*

## Phase 2: UI/UX Refinements for Suggestion Page (Completed)

**Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (Current Date)

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Refined Suggestion Display:**
    - Implemented thematic names (e.g., "L'√âcureuil Prudent üêøÔ∏è") and icons for suggestions on `SuggestionPage.tsx`.
    - Mapped strategy IDs to user-friendly names (e.g., "Ichimoku Cloud") for better readability.
    - Clarified presentation of performance metrics from AI evaluation, adding explanatory notes.
*   **Enhanced Backtest Result Display (Textual KPIs):**
    - Structured Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in a grid layout on `SuggestionPage.tsx`.
    - Improved labels and formatting for existing KPIs.
    - Updated the `BacktestResult` TypeScript type to include optional `CAGR` and `winningTradesPercentage` fields, which are now displayed as "N/A" pending backend support providing these values.
*   **Chart Integration for Backtest Results:**
    - Integrated `EquityChart` and `TradesOnPriceChart` components into the `SuggestionPage.tsx`'s backtest result view, providing visual representation of portfolio evolution and trade placements.
*   **Basic Animations & Transitions:**
    - Added slide-in effect for suggestion cards (staggered for multiple cards).
    - Implemented hover effects (scale/shadow) on suggestion cards.
    - Added fade-in effect for the backtest result section when it appears.
*   **Styling and Theme (Initial Pass):**
    - Applied "Inter" font application-wide via `index.css`.
    - Adjusted colors, spacing, and button styles on `SuggestionPage.tsx` and in global CSS (`index.css`) to align with a cleaner, light/pastel theme.
*   **Frontend Build Issue Resolution:**
    - Addressed and fixed various TypeScript errors and import issues that were preventing the frontend from building successfully. This included correcting prop types, handling type-only imports, removing unused code, and ensuring `react-router-dom` was correctly installed and configured.

**Next Steps (Phase 3):** Focus on advanced features, further polish, and more complex interactions.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish (Planned)

*   **Tooltips with Pedagogical Explanations (Completed):**
    - Implemented CSS-based tooltips on the `SuggestionPage.tsx`.
    - Info icons (‚ÑπÔ∏è) trigger tooltips on hover/focus, enhancing user understanding.
    - **Suggestion Cards:** Tooltips provide explanations for Thematic Names (risk/reward profile), Strategy Types (brief strategy logic), Performance Metrics (contextual explanation of P&L, Sharpe, Win Rate from AI eval), and Max Risk per Trade (calculation basis).
    - **Backtest Result KPIs:** Tooltips explain each displayed KPI, including Valeur Finale du Portefeuille, Profit/Perte Total (‚Ç¨ et %), Ratio de Sharpe, Max Drawdown (%), CAGR (annualis√©) (%), Pourcentage de Trades Gagnants (%), and Nombre Total de Trades.
    - All tooltip content is in French, aiming to provide educational value and clarity on financial/trading terms.
*   Advanced micro-interactions and animations (e.g., loading spinners, "confetti" on success).
*   Option ‚ÄúEnvoyer la strat√©gie par email‚Äù (requires SendGrid backend setup).
*   Subtle sound effects (optional/toggleable).
*   Further refinement of UI/UX based on user feedback.
*   Address any outstanding TODOs or minor bugs.
